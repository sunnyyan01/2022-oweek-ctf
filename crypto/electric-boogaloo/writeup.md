## Description
ASCII encoding is cool and all but the sequel is never as good as the original. 0s and 1s have nothing on dots and dashes.

**Format:** You don't need to wrap your answer with OWEEK{}. It's also not case-sensitive! Just enter your decoded message.

### Idea
Similar to morse code challenges in previous O-Week CTFs, hence the name `electric boogaloo` 

### Walkthrough
1. Replace `electric` with `.` (dot) and `boogaloo` with `-` (dash)
2. Convert the resulting morse code into text (either manually or with an [online decoder](https://morsedecoder.com/))
