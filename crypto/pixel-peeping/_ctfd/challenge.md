CSE let me borrow their Katana supercomputing cluster for a few hours and I decided to ask it for the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything. I was told the response would be in ASCII characters but to my surprise, it spit out an image with 42 pixels instead. They're all different shades of grey though, which is a little weird.
