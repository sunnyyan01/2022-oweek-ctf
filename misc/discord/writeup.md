### Idea
Use Discord search after joining and verifying in our server.

### Walkthrough
1. Note that the President's username is abiramen#2452.
2. It might be logical to try `from:abiramen#2452 OWEEK`, but you'll note this yields no flags. Try `from:abiramen#2452 flag`.
3. You'll find a flag in reverse here. Reverse the flag and submit it for those sweet, sweet points.

### Flag
`OWEEK{rev3rSe_th1$_w1LL_yoU}`
