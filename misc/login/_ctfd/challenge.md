I've created a program which gets the title of any webpage you want! I've restricted it to only get pages from our SecSoc website though - it's foolproof!! There's no accounts being used in the program but if you want the flag you're going to have to ["login" with a username (no password needed)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21427515)...
