### Idea
`robots.txt` challenges are boring and overused, why not chuck in a `sitemap.xml` challenge instead?

### Walkthrough
1. Navigate to `/sitemap.xml` to find out the "location" of the flag
2. Enter the location in the flag finder on the website index to retrieve the flag  

### Flag
`OWEEK{y@Y_y0u_foUnD_mE}`
