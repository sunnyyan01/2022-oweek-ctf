# cookie cutter 2fa

## Description
Passwordless login was a little too weak, so I've rebuilt my admin portal to require a password as well as an additional method of authentication. I'm so sure it's secure that I'll even give you the password: "omNoMnOmNOM123". Good luck trying to get in :)

### Idea
2 factor authentication usually involves a password and an additional method such as a one-time code sent to an phone number, email or generated by an authentication app or physical security key. These methods have been listed in order of increasing security, but are generally pretty secure.

Using unsigned cookies as an authentication method is a terrible idea in practice, especially as the sole method given that the attacker knows the correct password.

But it makes for a neat CTF challenge ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ (maybe a little too obvious though given the hints in the title/description).

### Walkthrough
1. Try to log in with the given password and notice that it's correct but the 2fa method is missing
2. [Chrome] Look in DevTools (F12) > Application > Cookies and replace the 2fa cookie's default value `what's 1 + 1` with the answer: `2`
3. Log in with the given password again, successfully :D
