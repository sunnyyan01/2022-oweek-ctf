Our marvellous, magnificent, splendid, fantastic, fabulous, out-of-this-world O-Week stall has a hotspot, but not the COVID kind.

### Idea
Wi-Fi hotspots/networks are a great place to put invisible messages!

### Walkthrough
1. Visit our O-Week SecSoc stall! (not that it exists at the time you're reading this)
2. At the stall, we had set up a router broadcasting a Wi-Fi network with the flag in it's name. The hotspot clue in the question would hopefully have prompted you to search for hotspots with your phone, and discover the flag!

### Flag
`OWEEK{its.in.the.air.around.you}`
