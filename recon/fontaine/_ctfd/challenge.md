i'm on holiday! ended up learning a new language on the side, because i forgot that they also spoke french here!

anyways, here's a fountain, or a *fontaine* as they call it. my camera lens is also slightly messed up oops.

i also don't quite remember the name of the fountain, so can you find it for me?

**Format**: Replace any underscores with spaces, and wrap your answer in `OWEEK{}`. For example, if the answer was the Lloyd Rees Fountain, then the answer would be `OWEEK{lloyd_rees_fountain}`.
