### Walkthrough
1. First you need to figure out which lab is Bongo Cat's favourite! There are many labs, but if you search for 'UNSW labs', especially Computer Science (CSE) labs, you'll notice they're all named after musical instruments! Surely Bongo Cat's favourite instrument are the bongos...
2. If you went to the Bongo lab location on campus, there was a QR code we'd placed outside the lab which linked you to the flag!

### Flag
`OWEEK{b0Ng0_c4t!_b0Ng0_CaT!!}`
